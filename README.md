# Unsupervised Anomaly Detection

This project demonstrates unsupervised anomaly detection using the **Isolation Forest algorithm**, a powerful and efficient technique designed to detect anomalies without labeled data. The implementation is done using Python in Jupyter Notebooks and includes all the necessary steps from data preprocessing to anomaly detection and visualization using PCA.
